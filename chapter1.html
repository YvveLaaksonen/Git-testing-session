    <h1>Chapter 1: <em>Spooky night</em></h1>
    <img src="photos/lights-2.jpg" />
    <p>
      It was Halloween night, the spookiest day of the year by far. The wind blew restlessly and <span class="fillslot">loudly</span> in a <span class="fillslot">scary</span> neighborhood. All houses in the neighborhood were decorated with lights <span class="fillslot">colours</span> and <span class="fillslot">candies</span> and some families had even put up <span class="fillslot">pumpkins</span> on their front lawns. Everything looked amazing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three friends, <span class="fillslot">Anthony</span>, <span class="fillslot">Jim</span> and <span class="fillslot">Cathy</span>
      had gathered at <span class="fillslot">Anthony's</span> house. The trio had been friends since and it was their yearly
      tradition to spend Halloween night together at one their houses. They'd watch <span class="fillslot">movies</span> and <span class="fillslot">videos</span>. Though the main event of the evening, one that everyone was impatiently
      waiting for, was of course <span class="fillslot">ghosts</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="fillslot">Jim</span> loved the candy and would probably eat of their loot before they finished their
      round. <span class="fillslot">John</span> and <span class="fillslot">Jill</span> however, were more excited about their
      costumes. Especially <span class="fillslot">John</span> couldn't wait to show off their costume that their had for
      them. So as soon as <span class="fillslot">tall</span> <span class="fillslot">John</span> brought up the costumes...
    </p>
    <br>
    <div class="dialog-wrapper">
      <p>
        <span class="fillslot">John</span>: "Shouldn't we get into our costumes? <span class="fillslot">Hoho</span> <br>
        <span class="fillslot">Jim</span>: "No way, it's way too early. Aren't we heading out <span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span>? Besides, my
        <span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span> costume <span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span>." <br>
        <span class="fillslot">C</span>: "Actually, I should go by my house really quickly and get <span
          class="fillslot">insert pet/pet's name</span>" <br>
        A or B_: "Wait what, are you bringing your <span class="fillslot">pet</span> trick-or-treating?" <br>
        <span class="fillslot">C</span>: "Yep! <span class="fillslot">pet's name</span> is part of my costume! I'll be
        <span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span> and <span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span> will be <span
          class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span>."
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="fillslot">A</span> and <span class="fillslot">B</span> <span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span>. Both of them
        doubted whether it would be a good idea to <span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="fillslot">C</span>: "Oh come one! It will be awesome! Just give me <span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span> and I'll go get <span
          class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span> and we can head out then."
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="fillslot">C</span> looked at their friends <span class="fillslot">(how?)</span>. The other two
        considered the idea. <span class="fillslot">C</span> was clearly excited about their idea and the other two did
        not want to <span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span>. And after all, what could even go wrong?
      </p>
      <p>
          <span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span>: "Okay, fine. Go get <span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span>. We'll <span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span> while we wait for you."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Yes, awesome! Oh we're gonna look so cool! This is going to be the best Halloween yet", <span
          class="fillslot">C</span> exclaimed with excitment, jumped off the couch and ran out of the living room. Soon the other two heard <span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span>.
