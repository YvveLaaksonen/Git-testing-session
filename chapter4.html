      The house smelled like mud and old socks as the kids 58136fd62a54347ee73b9e7e1b1e41aa57d5b9a3
      walk across the creepy hall. The house seems to be empty but still they can't help
      feeling like intruders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look! That door is open!" Jim points to a door on the left.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Could Cathy's bloody dogs have gone there? Maybe they already returned outside...", the kids whispers their voice trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No they definitely are here", says Jim who has reached the open door first. "I
      can
      see their footsteps in the dust. And they are only going one way...", Anthony gulps.
    </p>
    <p>
      The others gather next to them and look down narrow stairway that must go in to the basement of the house.
      However,
      all they can see in the end of the stairs is complete darkness...
    </p>
    <p>
      But then they hear howling from the attic. They are trapped!
