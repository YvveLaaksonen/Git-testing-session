    <p>
      <span class="fillslot">All of</span> the houses have put Halloween decorations up and <span class="fillslot">most</span> of them have lights on. There were also some skeletons and scary creatures. All three kids walk close to each other and <span class="fillslot">Cathy</span> is holding on to their <span class="fillslot">dog</span>. Earlier they were all <span class="fillslot">excited</span> and <span class="fillslot">happy</span> but now they are all <spanclass="fillslot">getting a bit worried</span>. Though none of them would admit it to each other, they are all <span class="fillslot">super scared</span>.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe we should turn back?" <span class="fillslot">she</span> almost whispers. "It doesn't seem like we're gonna get a lot of <span class="fillslot">happening</span> here. Besides, I don't like the <span class="fillslot">silence</span>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yeah... And look, that <span class="fillslot">bush</span> looks like it's <span class="fillslot">moving</span>", <span class="fillslot">C</span> whispers back pointing at a <span class="fillslot">park</span> on their left.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before the others can respond, the leaves of the nearby hedge ruffle and <span class="fillslot">start moving</span>.
    </p>
    <p>"<span class="fillslot">Watch out</span>", <span class="fillslot">Jim</span> screams. As they back off from the hedge they knock <span class="fillslot">some bikes</span> over. What follows is <span class="fillslot">few</span> seconds of utter chaos.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="fillslot">Cathy</span> is the first to recover. As soon as they do, they realise <span class="fillslot">that the dog has disappeared</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is <span class="fillslot">C's pet</span>?", <span class="fillslot">B</span> says sounding nervous and looking around.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There! On the porch!" <span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span> cries out pointing at the house on their left. And
      sure enough, <span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span> is standing at the porch seemingly curious about the <span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span> house. The front door is slightly open, and before the trio manages to even call for them, <span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span> and <span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh no....", <span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span> whispers, their face turning white. "This is not good..."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have to go after <span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span>, there's no other option", <span
 class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span> says trying to sound <span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span> but looking just as
      nervous as <span class="fillslot">&nbsp;</span>. Scared they head towards the house...
